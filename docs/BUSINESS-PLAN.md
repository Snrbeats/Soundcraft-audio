## TRACK 2: Platform (The Bigger Play)

### Problem Statement
Gig platforms (Fiverr, Upwork) take 20%+ fees, race to bottom pricing, algorithm controls your livelihood. Creators get underpaid, clients get inconsistent quality.

### Solution Concept: "SoundBridge" (working name)
A creator-first audio marketplace that:
- Lower fees (10% vs 20%)
- Verified credentials (real audio engineers, not hobbyists)
- AI-assisted matching (right pro for the job)
- Built-in tools (file transfer, revision tracking, payments)
- Transparent pricing (no race to bottom)

### MVP Features
1. Profile/portfolio pages for audio pros
2. Project posting for clients
3. Matching algorithm
4. Secure payments with escrow
5. File sharing + revision system

### Differentiators
- Audio-specific (not generic freelance)
- Quality gate (credentials, portfolio review)
- Fair pricing guidance (market rates, not exploitation)
- Community owned? (future consideration)

### Revenue Model
- 10% platform fee (half of competitors)
- Premium pro profiles ($20/mo)
- Featured listings
- Enterprise/agency tier

### Build Strategy
- Validate with services clients first
- Build waitlist while running services
- MVP in 60-90 days (we can vibe code this)
- Launch to existing network + their networks
