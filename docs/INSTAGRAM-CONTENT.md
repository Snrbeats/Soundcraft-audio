**Slide 1:**
```
5 audio mistakes killing 
your content
(and how to fix them)
```

**Slide 2:**
```
1. Recording too quiet

Fix: Record louder or normalize
after. Quiet audio = noisy audio
when boosted.
```

**Slide 3:**
```
2. Room echo

Fix: Record in a treated space
or use noise reduction.
Blankets work.
```

**Slide 4:**
```
3. Inconsistent levels

Fix: Use compression.
Keeps loud and quiet parts
balanced.
```

**Slide 5:**
```
4. No presence

Fix: EQ boost around 3kHz
makes voice cut through.
```

**Slide 6:**
```
5. Wrong loudness

Fix: Normalize to platform standards
