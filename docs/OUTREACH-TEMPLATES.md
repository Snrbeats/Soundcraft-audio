# Client Outreach Templates

## Podcasters (Twitter/X DM)

### Template 1: Value First
```
Hey [Name]! Been listening to [Podcast Name] — really solid content.

Quick thought: your audio could hit harder with some pro mixing. I'm an audio engineer and I do podcast production.

Want me to clean up a 5-min clip for free? No strings. Just want to show you what's possible.
```

### Template 2: Problem Aware
```
Hey [Name], caught your latest episode of [Podcast Name].

Noticed some background noise/echo that's easy to fix. I specialize in podcast audio — would you be open to a quick free sample edit?

Takes me 10 mins and you'll hear the difference immediately.
```

### Template 3: Direct Offer
```
Hey [Name]! Your podcast is great but the audio is holding it back.

## YouTubers / Content Creators

### Template 1: Specific Feedback
```
Hey [Name], love your content on [topic].

One thing that could take your videos to the next level — the audio mix. Your voice could punch through more and the music levels could be balanced better.

I do audio post for creators. Want me to remix a short clip to show you?
```

### Template 2: Growth Angle
```
Hey [Name]! Your videos deserve better audio.

Studies show viewers drop off when audio quality is poor — even if visuals are great. I help creators sound professional.

Free 60-second sample edit if you're curious. What do you say?

## Independent Artists (Instagram/Twitter)

### Template 1: Peer to Peer
```
Hey [Name], just heard [Song] — you've got something.

The mix could use some work though. I'm an audio engineer and I do mixing/mastering for independent artists.

$150/track, unlimited revisions until you're happy. Interested?
```
